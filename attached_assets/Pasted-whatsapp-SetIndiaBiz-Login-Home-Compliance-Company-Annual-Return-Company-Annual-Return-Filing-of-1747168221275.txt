What is the Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The annual general meeting of a company is the meeting of the shareholders to adopt the audited financial statements, re-elect the board members, declare dividends, and appoint the statutory auditor of the company. The AGM is a statutory meeting under section 96 of the Companies Act 2013. The first AGM must be held within nine months, and the subsequent AGM must be held within six months of the end of the financial year.

The Board of Directors is under a statutory obligation to convene the AGM and must give every shareholder a 21-clear-day Notice of the AGM. The AGM should be held on a working day within the city limits of the registered office address; however, nowadays, AGM may be done through Video Conferencing.

Due Date of Annual General Meeting
The annual return filing to the ROC would depend on the date on which the AGM took place. Therefore, it is necessary first to understand the applicability of the AGM and the last date within which the AGM must be completed. The companies can be classified into three categories to determine the AGM’s applicability and due date. The table below uses FY 2023-24 as a reference.

Particulars	Incorporated on or after 1st January of FY 2023-24	Incorporated in FY 2023-24, but on or before 31 December 2024	Incorporated Prior to FY 2023-24
AGM Applicable?	Not Applicable	Yes, First AGM	Yes, Subsequent AGM
AGM Due Date	Not Applicable	31 December 2024	30 September 2024
ADT-1 Due Date	Not Applicable	15 January 2025	15 October 2024
AOC-4 Due Date	Not Applicable	29 January 2025	29 October 2024
MGT-7A Due Date	Not Applicable	28 February 2025	28 November 2024
Consequences of Default in Annual General Meeting
For any default concerning AGM or any provision of section 96 to 98 of the Companies Act, 2013, every director or KMP of the company shall be punishable with a file that may extend to Rs One Lakh. In case of a continuing offence, the ROC imposes a penalty of Rs 5000 for every default day.

One Person Company (OPC) Annual Return
In OPC, only one individual person holds the entire shareholding. Therefore, the provisions relating to the Annual General Meeting do not apply. The due dates for ROC Annual Return Filing for OPC are fixed. The applicability of filing the AOC-4 and MGT-7 would be based on the date of incorporation. The table below provides the due date for the annual return filing for the OPC for FY 2023-24.

Particulars	Incorporated on or after 1st January of FY 2023-24	Incorporated on or before 31st December 2024
AGM	Not Applicable	Not Applicable
ADT-1 Due Date	Not Applicable	15 Day of Appointment
AOC-4 Due Date	Not Applicable	27 September 2024
MGT-7A Due Date	Not Applicable	28 November 2024
Note:
Though OPC is exempt from holding the AGM, the due date for the ROC Annual Return in MGT-7A is calculated based on the regular timeline of the AGM, as if it is applicable. However, the audit financial statements of the OPC need to be filed with the ROC within 180 days of the end of the financial year. As the auditor is not appointed in the AGM but by the Board of Directors, the filing of ADT-1 would be required within 15 days of the auditor appointment.
