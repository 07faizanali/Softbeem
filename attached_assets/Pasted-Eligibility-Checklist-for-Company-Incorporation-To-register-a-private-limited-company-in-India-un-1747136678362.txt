Eligibility & Checklist for Company Incorporation
To register a private limited company in India under the Companies Act 2013, you need to meet these essential requirements. Our experts at Setindiabiz guide you through each requirement, ensuring compliance with the latest regulations for a smooth and hassle-free online company registration process.

1. Minimum Two Shareholder
For Company Registration in India, a minimum of two shareholders is mandatory. These shareholders must sign the MOA as subscribers and contribute the initial capital. The maximum number of shareholders is capped at two hundred.

2. Minimum Two Directors
The company directors are responsible for the day-to-day management of the company and general compliance with the applicable laws in India. A minimum of two individual directors is mandatory, whereas the maximum number of directors in a private limited company is capped at fifteen.

3. At Least One Resident Indian Director
One of the company's directors must have resided in India for at least 120 days during the previous financial years. The Indian resident director is generally responsible for the company's overall tax and other filing compliance.

4. Unique Name of Company
The proposed name for a new company incorporation in India must be unique and distinct from other companies registered in India, including LLPs or trademarks. It should conform with the name availability guidelines issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). Setindiabiz helps with the name availability search and its approval by the ROC.

5. Capital for the New Company
Though no prescribed minimum or maximum capital is required for company registration in India, the promoters must budget the fund's requirements to start the business and decide the appropriate capital at the time of company incorporation. It is to be noted that the government fee and stamp duty on MOA, AOA, and SPICe+ form vary based on capital and the state.

6. Legal Object or Activity
The main object is described in part three of the MOA, which sets a limit on the proposed business activities that shall be pursued after the incorporation of the new company. The main object clause of the MOA should be legal and from one specific sector only. We will help you draft the company's main object and select the correct activity code as per NIC 2008

Eligibility
Private Limited Company vs LLP vs Sole Proprietorship
Before you register your business, it‚Äôs crucial to understand how India‚Äôs three most popular structures compare. A Private Limited Company (Companies Act 2013), a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP Act 2008), and a Sole Proprietorship (no dedicated statute; registered through tax and local licenses) each cater to different needs for growth, funding, and compliance. Below, we‚Äôve compiled a simple comparison of Private Limited Company vs LLP vs Sole Proprietorship to help you understand each option.

Feature	Private Limited Company	LLP	Sole Proprietorship
Separate legal entity	Yes	Yes	No ‚Äì owner and business are the same
Limited liability	‚úî Yes, up to unpaid share capital	‚úî Yes, up to the agreed contribution	‚úñ No, unlimited personal liability
Governing law	Companies Act 2013 & rules	LLP Act 2008 & rules	No dedicated Act; regulated by Shops & Establishments Act, GST, Income-tax, etc.
Foundational document	Memorandum & Articles (MoA + AoA)	LLP Agreement	None (only registrations and licenses)
Minimum owners	2 shareholders & 2 directors (same people allowed)	2 designated partners	1 individual
Maximum owners	200 shareholders	No upper limit	1
Capital structure	Share capital: easy to issue new shares, ESOPs	Partner contribution	Owner‚Äôs personal capital
Outside investment & FDI	Preferred by VCs/PEs; smoother FDI, ESOPs	Possible but less popular with equity investors	Practically impossible
Tax rate (AY 2025-26)	22% (sec 115BAA) or 15% for new mfg co‚Äôs + surcharge + cess; dividends taxed in shareholders‚Äô hands	30% + surcharge + cess; profit share exempt for partners	Individual slab rates (up to 30% + cess)
Audit requirement	Compulsory, regardless of turnover	Only if turnover > ‚Çπ40 cr or contribution > ‚Çπ25 lakh	Only if turnover > ‚Çπ1 cr (business) or ‚Çπ50 lakh (profession) under Income-tax Act
Annual filings	AOC-4, MGT-7A, DIR-3 KYC, etc. to MCA	Form 8, Form 11, DIR-3 KYC	Income-tax return + GST returns; no ROC filings
Compliance effort & cost	Highest ‚Äì board meetings, registers, event-based filings	Moderate ‚Äì fewer meetings, simplified ROC forms	Lowest ‚Äì basic tax & license renewals
Credibility with lenders & buyers	High	Medium	Low (depends on owner‚Äôs credit)
Ideal for	Startups seeking scale, equity funding, and brand credibility	Professional firms, family businesses, capital-light ventures wanting flexibility	Solo entrepreneurs testing an idea with minimal cost and paperwork
Quick Takeaway: For investor confidence, ESOPs, and scalable governance, üëçchoose a Private Limited Company. An LLP is suitable for limited liability with lighter compliance and active partner management. A Sole Proprietorship is best for low-risk, small-scale ventures prioritising simplicity and minimal cost, with the option to upgrade as the business grows.

The entire company incorporation process is online, and the application to incorporate the company is digitally signed by the directors using DSC.

Step - 2

Name Search for Availability
According to the Companies Act 2013, the name of the proposed company must be unique and not identical or similar to any existing business (such as a company or LLP) or trademark. We conduct a thorough name availability search to ensure your chosen name meets regulatory standards, saving you time during the company registration process and avoiding potential conflicts.

Step - 3

Drafting of MOA & AOA
The Memorandum of Association (MOA) and Articles of Association (AOA) are the key legal documents that define the business activities that a company shall pursue after the incorporation of the company. Our expert team assists in drafting the incorporation documents, ensuring they align with legal requirements and your business vision.

Step - 4

Filing of SPICe+ for Company Incorporation
The next step is to prepare and file the application for company registration using the SPICe+ form, which is the prescribed form under the Companies Act 2013. Documents such as MOA, AOA, promoters' identity and address proof, registered office proof, and NOC are attached to the Spice Plus form.

Step - 5

Issuance of the Company Incorporation Certificate
Once your SPICe+ form is reviewed and approved, the ROC issues your Certificate of Incorporation. This certificate, which includes your Company Identification Number (CIN), PAN, TAN, and director DIN numbers, proves that your new company is legally established.

Benefits of Company Registration In India
A Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) is India‚Äôs most trusted business structure under the Companies Act, 2013 (as amended by the latest Companies (Amendment) Act 2023). It blends legal protection, scalability, and credibility. Setindiabiz simplifies the company incorporation process and enables you to build your dream startup in India quickly.

Limited Liability Protection
Shareholders' liability is restricted to their investment amount, protecting personal assets from business debts and legal claims. This separation creates a safety net for entrepreneurs taking calculated business risks.

Enhanced Business Credibility
A registered Private Limited Company projects professionalism and legitimacy to customers, suppliers, and business partners. The "Pvt. Ltd." suffix signals compliance with regulatory standards and builds trust in your business operations.

Easier Access to Funding
Private Limited Companies can attract investments through equity shares, venture capital, angel investors, and institutional funding. Banks and financial institutions also offer preferential loan terms to registered companies with proper documentation.

Tax Advantages and Flexibility
Companies enjoy various tax benefits including lower tax rates (as low as 15% for manufacturing companies under Section 115BAB), tax deductions on business expenses, and strategic tax planning opportunities that aren't available to other business structures

Separate Legal Entity Status
Your company exists independently of its founders and shareholders, allowing it to own assets, enter contracts, and conduct business in its own name. This separation facilitates smoother operations and transitions.

Perpetual Succession
Unlike proprietorships or partnerships, a Private Limited Company continues to exist regardless of changes in ownership, management, or the death of founders. This ensures business continuity and long-term stability.

Transferable Ownership
Shares in a Private Limited Company can be transferred (within regulatory limits), making ownership changes, succession planning, and exit strategies more systematic and legally straightforward

Incorporated Entity
Private Limited Company registration under the Companies Act 2013 offers significant advantages that make it India's most preferred business structure for startups and growing businesses:

For startups and entrepreneurs, registering as a Private Limited Company isn‚Äôt just about legal formality ‚Äì it‚Äôs about unlocking growth. This structure makes it easier to attract investors and venture capital, hire top talent with equity offers, and expand nationally or internationally. In India‚Äôs startup ecosystem, a ‚ÄòPvt Ltd‚Äô after your company‚Äôs name adds significant credibility when pitching to customers or incubators.

Once your company is incorporated, you must understand the post-incorporation compliances and other necessary activities that must be completed within the next few weeks.

To give you a clear picture, we've created a simple comparison table highlighting the key tax parameters for Domestic Companies versus LLPs for AY 2025‚Äë26.
