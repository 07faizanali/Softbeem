What are Statutory Registers?
Statutory registers, as mandated by the Companies Act, 2013, are foundational documents that record essential information about a company’s operations. They serve as repositories of crucial details such as shareholder particulars, directorships, meeting minutes, investments, and so on. These registers play a crucial role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and adherence to regulatory standards prescribed within law.

As essential records, they provide critical data needed for legal proceedings, audits, and stakeholders’ inspections conducted in the due course of business. Moreover, these documents serve as a reflection of the company’s commitment to corporate best practices.

Legal Framework for Statutory Registers Under Companies Act
The Companies Act, 2013 establishes the legal framework for companies in India, outlining requirements for maintaining statutory registers. These registers, containing vital company information, are mandated by various sections of the Act. Let’s delve into the details of each of these sections one by one. The prominent sections we will cover include Sections 85, 88, 90, 94, 95 and 118.

Maintaining Register of Members (Section 88)
Section 88 of the Companies Act, 2013 specifically mandates the maintenance of certain registers by companies. It requires companies to maintain registers such as the Register of Members, Register of Debenture Holders, and Register of Directors and Key Managerial Personnel. These registers are fundamental in documenting the ownership structure, debt obligations, and leadership hierarchy of the company.

Maintaining Register of Charges (Section 85)
Under Section 85 of the Companies Act, 2013, companies are required to maintain a Register of Charges. This register details any charges created on the company’s assets, such as mortgages or loans secured against company property. This ensures transparency regarding the company’s financial liabilities and encumbrances on its assets.

Maintaining Register of Significant Beneficial Owner (Section 90)
Section 90 of the Companies Act, 2013 requires companies to maintain a Register of Significant Beneficial Owners. This register identifies individuals who hold significant beneficial ownership or control over the company’s shares or voting rights. This helps in identifying and disclosing individuals with significant influence or control over the company’s affairs, enhancing transparency and preventing misuse of corporate structures for illicit purposes.

Keeping Registers at Company’s Registered Office (Section 94)
Section 94 of the Companies Act, 2013, mandates the location and accessibility of registers and returns maintained by companies. It stipulates that these registers and copies of annual returns must be kept at the registered office of the company. However, if more than one-tenth of the total number of members reside in a different location, they may also be maintained there with approval through a special resolution.

The section ensures accessibility for inspection by members, debenture-holders, and other stakeholders during business hours without fees, and permits the taking of extracts or copies upon payment of prescribed fees. Refusal of inspection may incur penalties, and the Central Government holds authority to intervene if necessary. The exact penalties have been discussed further.

Registers to be Prima Facie Evidence (Section 95)
The registers, their indices, and copies of annual returns maintained under Sections 88 and 94 are considered prima facie evidence of any matter directed or authorized to be inserted therein by or under the Companies Act. This means that these documents are presumed to be accurate and authentic unless proven otherwise, thereby serving as reliable evidence in legal proceedings or disputes concerning the company’s affairs.

Maintaining Register for Minutes of Meeting (Section 118)
Section 118 of the Companies Act, 2013 pertains to the maintenance of minute books containing records of general meetings, board meetings, and meetings of board committees.

Physical Registers: Traditionally, statutory registers and books were maintained in bound books or loose-leaf folders kept at the registered office of the company. While physical registers offer a tangible record, they require careful storage and organization to ensure accessibility and preservation.
Electronic Registers: With advancements in technology, many companies opt to maintain statutory registers and books in electronic format.

However, companies must ensure compliance with regulatory requirements regarding electronic maintenance, including data security and integrity measures.
Location of Maintenance
The Companies Act specifies that statutory books must be maintained at the registered office of the company. However, certain registers may also be maintained at other locations within India under specific circumstances, such as the residence of a significant number of members.

Registered Office: The primary location for maintaining statutory registers is the registered office of the company. This ensures centralization of records and facilitates ease of access for stakeholders, including directors, members, and regulatory authorities.
Alternative Locations: In cases where more than one-tenth of the total number of members reside in a location other than the registered office, companies may seek approval through a special resolution to maintain registers at such locations. However, this requires compliance with prescribed procedures and notification to the Registrar of Companies.

Registers must be regularly updated, accurately maintained, and made available for inspection by stakeholders as per the provisions of the Companies Act.
